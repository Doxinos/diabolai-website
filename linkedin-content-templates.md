# 21 Highly Effective Content Templates for LinkedIn by Charles Miller x Taplio

## Introduction

Hey, I'm Charles Miller. I've built an audience of over **300,000 followers** across social media, including **133,000 on LinkedIn**, and turned that into a business that makes at least **$1,000 a day**.

These **21 LinkedIn Content Templates** will help you create better content **faster**. They're not basic "fill-in-the-blank" formulas (because those rarely work). Instead, they provide a **flexible structure** that's proven to engage and convert.

## How to Use These Templates with Taplio

1. **Open Taplio** and go to the "Create" section
2. **Choose a template** from the list below
3. **Fill in the structure** with your own content
4. **Customize** the tone and style to match your brand
5. **Add relevant hashtags** and schedule your post

## Template 1: BAB - Before, After, Bridge

**Description:** This template shows transformation and creates curiosity about the "bridge" (your solution).

**Structure:**
- **Before:** Describe the problem or current state
- **After:** Show the desired outcome or result
- **Bridge:** Explain how to get from before to after (your solution)

**Example:**
```
Before: I was spending 3 hours every morning checking emails and social media.

After: Now I check everything in 15 minutes and start my day focused.

The bridge? I created a simple morning routine that prioritizes what matters most.

What's your morning routine like?

## Template 2: ABB - After, Before, Bridge

**Description:** Similar to BAB but leads with the result to grab attention immediately.

**Structure:**
- **After:** Start with the impressive result

- **Bridge:** Explain the transformation process

**Example:**
```
After: I just closed a $50K deal with a client I met on LinkedIn.

Before: 6 months ago, I had 0 connections and 0 clients from social media.

The bridge? I started posting valuable content 3x per week and engaging with my target audience daily.
